Vantage Point Acquisition and Data Collection
--------------------------------------------
Our client-side scripts acquire vantage points from two sources:
- Residential proxies: Proxyrack
- VPN nodes: Hide-My-IP

Procedure:
1. Provisioning (Experiments 1 & 2)
   - We subscribe to Proxyrack and retrieve the required credentials, including the API key,
     port number, username, and password.

2. Connecting to Proxies
   - We use `curl` to call the Proxyrack API and connect to a proxy entry node,
     the corresponding exit node serves as the vantage point for the experiment.

3. Probing and Logging
   - The client side scripts generate probing requests sent from each vantage point to our
     remote control servers.
   - HTTP responses and metadata are recorded in designated output files for data analysis.

4. VPN Nodes (Case Studies)
   - VPN nodes from Hide-My-IP are used exclusively for case studies.
   - We must ensure that Hide-My-IP remains active and stable throughout the experiment.
   - Each execution triggers application traceroutes from a single VPN node to 12 control servers.
   - The HTTP request header field contains a sensitive domain, which will trigger censorship
     if censoring servers are present along the path.

Control Server Setup
--------------------
The remote control servers are deployed on major public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
and distributed across multiple regions.

For Experiment 1:
- Six control servers are set up on AWS EC2 instances running Ubuntu.
- Steps for setup:
  1. Launch an AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu as the operating system.
  2. Connect to the instance from the client side.
  3. Run the following commands:
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get upgrade -y
       sudo apt-get install apache2
  4. Edit the Apache2 landing page (using `vi`) to serve the static payloads "http/n".
  5. Open port 80 to allow the control server to receive HTTP requests globally.

For Experiment 2 & Case Studies:
- Twelve control servers with the same setup are established on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

To verify that the control server is working correctly, copy its IP address into a web browser.
If successful, the page will display "http".

Limitations
-----------
For Experiments 1 and 2, we rely on residential proxies from Proxyrack, which are randomly
assigned, and its proxy pool is frequently updated. This makes it difficult to reproduce experiment results,
even when using the same service. The same limitation applies to VPN nodes from
Hide-My-IP, as the availability of specific countries or regions may change over time.

Some residential proxies or VPN nodes cannot sustain a full experiment (across multiple control servers) 
and may switch to another proxy or terminate the session. To mitigate this, we implement a live proxy check 
to ensure the proxy remains consistent and active throughout the entire experiment. Despite these measures, 
inadvertent termination may occur in extreme conditions. Additionally, Control servers rely on third-party 
cloud infrastructure, which introduces further dependencies. Due to these limitations, it is not feasible 
to execute all components of the experiments within a single public research infrastructure or guarantee perfect reproducibility.
