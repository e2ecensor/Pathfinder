Constraints
-----------
This artifact is subject to several constraints:

1. Infrastructure Dependence 
   Our experiments leverage two types of proxies to access vantage points:
   - Residential proxies (Proxyrack) in Experiments 1 & 2  
   - VPN nodes (Hide-My-IP)for case studies  

   In experiments 1 & 2, we leverage residential proxies as our vantage point 
   to send probing requests to our control servers. Specifically, we need to 
   connect with the Proxyrack API from our client side. To do so, we need another file, 
   proxy.json, to store all the credentials needed to connect to a third-party host API.
   This becomes one constraint to engage this proxy infrastructure with other infrastructures.


2. Manual VPN Configuration  
   The VPN nodes used in our case studies require manual configuration via the
   Hide-My-IP portal (e.g., enabling `IP Non-Repeat` and `Always Use The Same IP`).
   Once the experiments begin, Hide-My-IP must remain active for the entire process.
   Moreover, it takes manual monitoring effort to ensure the VPN node remains stable.

3. Control Server Setup 
   Our control servers are deployed across three major public cloud platforms
   (AWS, Azure, and GCP). Each server runs Apache and is distributed across multiple
   geographic regions.  
   Although the procedure for setting up Apache web servers on EC2 instances or virtual
   machines is similar across platforms, additional manual configuration steps
   are required on both the client and cloud sides. These setup steps are documented
   in `use.txt`.  
   Due to these manual requirements, it is infeasible to fully integrate the control
   server infrastructure with client-side scripts, proxies, and other dependencies
   into a single public research infrastructure.

4. Reproducibility Limitations  
   Due to evolving censorship policies and techniques, although our approach allows 
   continuous monitoring of path diversity and censorship inconsistency, exact 
   reproduction of experimental results may not be possible.
   Factors such as:
   - Evolving blocklists
   - Changing network conditions
   - Proxy or VPN pool updates  
   may lead to variations in observed censorship behavior or statistics.  

   Nevertheless, our platform remains a valid and robust tool for exploring
   censorship inconsistency. Users can expect consistent functionality and
   methodology, even if specific results differ over time.
